# Data-Collection-Projects
Includes two data-collection / web-scrapping projects.

### **AN OVERVIEW**
**Data collection** is the systematic approach to gathering and measuring information from a variety of sources to get a complete and accurate picture of an area of interest. Data collection enables a person or organisation to answer relevant questions, evaluate outcomes and make predictions about future probabilities and trends.

One of the possible ways of collecting this data is through **web-scraping**. Web scraping is the process of collecting structured web data in an **automated** fashion. Itâ€™s also called **web data extraction**. 

In the two projects that I have completed, my main intention was to learn and get an understanding of web-scrapping for data collection. It has immensely helped me to get a hand-on experience in data extraction and has thus enabled me to appreciate the power of python libraries like bs4, requests, etc.

The two projects included in this repository are: '_**Renkon Currency Convertor**_' and '_**Github Sponsors - Data Extraction**_'
